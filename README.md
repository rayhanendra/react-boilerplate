# Material UI - Next.js App Router example in TypeScript

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) App Router project bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with Material UI installed.

This example uses [`next/font/google`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts#google-fonts) to automatically optimize and load Roboto, a custom Google Font.
